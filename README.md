The most complex project so far, but a fun one. I am especially loving how the colors popped out as I was not too confident on the styling part.
There were a few hiccups especially the chaining of operations and the "=" button, but getting to the final solution was very satisfactory.
Super excited at the end of the foundation and beginning of the full-stack course.
Hope you like it and,
Thank You, for your time ❤️
